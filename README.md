### üõ† Technology

There are the technology that I used in this project

- [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

### Architecture

### `GitHub`

In GitHub I used 3 kinds of "enviroment":

### `master`

It is used for a production enviroment, all the final versions are here

### `stage`

It is used for a test enviroment, when I create a functionality and I've tested this functionality on develop enviroment, I merge this code on stage branch for all testers.

### `develop`

It is used for a development enviroment, all the functionality where create here

### Code Architecture

On beer celler I've used MockAPi to simulate a request from an API. To make this request (GET, POST, PUT) I used Axios.
I also used React-Router-Dom to create the routes and ReactJS as an visual interface.
To style my components I've just used a simple css

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
