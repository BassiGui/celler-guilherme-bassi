## Prerequisite

Before start, you will need to install some settings in your computer, like:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), You will also need a good editor to see the code, I recomend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## üõ† Technology

These are the technologies that I have used in this project:

- [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

## Architecture

### `GitHub`

In GitHub I used 3 kinds of "enviroment":
I¬¥ve decided to use 3 types of "enviroments"

### `master`

Master is used for a production enviroment, all the final versions are here

### `stage`

Stage is a test environment. When we finalize the functionality we merge the development code to the stage for testers validate the new feature.

### `develop`

Develop is used for a development environment and all the new features are created in this branch.

### Code Architecture

For this project I‚Äôve decide to start with the UI to have a better solution and view from all components together. To control the URL I‚Äôve inserted the React-Router-Dom to make the navigation of the website.
After that, I‚Äôve started to create the functionalities and for data control I‚Äôve used MockAPI to simulate a request from an API. And then, I‚Äôve integrated Axios into my code for the API communication.

## Versions

- NodeJs v18.1.0

## Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
